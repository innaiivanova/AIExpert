**Background**

People lack AI knowledge. In the future many jobs will be lost because of AI. So people need to get qualified in order to live well in the AI world. AI or ML is not taught at schools and universities by default. So people, who are curious and interested in learning should have the chance to do so. There are too many sources online that could be used, but not in form of games.

**Data and AI techniques** 

- Chat bots
- Decision trees
- Recommendation systems
- NLP
- Avatars
- Others

**How is it used** 

People will play games in different knowlege levels. The goal would be to retain the information by repetition and application in the game.
At the end of each level participants can get a certificat.
The maximum level grants an AIExpert certificate, which indicates the different fields of study that were mastered.

**Challenges**

The first challenge of the project is to create the games at different levels.
The second challenge is to implement different AI methods to teach AI concepts.
The third challenge is the practical application of the learned material.

**What next** 

AIExpert should become the go to address for learning. 
Once the game has proven successful for adults, it can be extended with a different version for kids.

I am thankful to anybody, who wants to join and start working with me on such an ambitious project.
